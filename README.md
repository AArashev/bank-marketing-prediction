Predicting Bank Marketing Campaign Outcomes Using Classification and Regression Models".





# Bank Marketing Prediction

This project involves predicting the outcomes of bank marketing campaigns using various classification and regression models. The dataset contains information about phone calls made by a Portuguese bank to market term deposits. The goal is to determine whether a client will subscribe to the product based on various features.

## Project Structure

- **`Regression_Final.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter notebook containing the entire workflow, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
  
## Models Used

1. **Logistic Regression**: For binary classification of subscription outcomes.
2. **Random Forest Classifier**: To predict whether a client will subscribe based on categorical and numerical features.
3. **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**: Used with a tuned parameter grid for optimal classification performance.
4. **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**: Applied to predict continuous target variables (regression task).
5. **Decision Tree Regression**: Simple model for regression tasks with decision trees.
6. **Random Forest Regression**: Ensemble method for continuous predictions.

## Feature Engineering and Preprocessing

- Categorical features were one-hot encoded.
- Numerical features were scaled where needed (e.g., for SVC and Logistic Regression).
- Feature selection was applied for regression tasks to pick the most relevant variables.

## Results and Evaluation

- Models were evaluated based on metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, **F1 score** for classification, and **MSE**, **RÂ²** for regression.
- The best performance was achieved by the **Random Forest Classifier** in classification and the **Random Forest Regressor** in regression tasks.
